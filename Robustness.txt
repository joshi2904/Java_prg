Robustness Testing Scenarious
example =Blinking.

Specific secnarios can cause softwear failure due to a lack of softwear robustness.The scenarious that can be tested are.


1)Test for handling large amount of data.
=>Multiple uesres are trying to access website at the same time.

2)Test for unexpected inputs and edge cases.
=>Incident of outoff stock case. 

3)Test for system failures and recovery.
=>Event were multipale networking are working find a specific note is failed due to outed.

4)Test for long period of sustained usage.
=>Longer liability with accessing multipale funcationality for entier life softwear.

5)Test for compatibility with various hardware and software environments.
